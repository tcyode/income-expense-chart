# 🛠️ Development Notes & Roadmap (Baba Style)

Hey developer soul 👩‍💻👨‍💻 — welcome to the inside scoop! ✨ This doc keeps track of everything we’ve done, what’s cooking, and where this little chart friend could grow next. Think of it as your cozy dev diary 📓💡

---

## ✅ What We Built
- A Python program that turns income + expenses into a **stacked bar chart**
- **Green bars** for income 💚, stacked colors for expense categories 🌈
- A **red dotted line** for net income ❤️📉📈
- Sweet little **labels for March 2025** categories for clarity 🏷️
- Export to PNG with high quality

---

## 🧱 Tools We Used
- Python 3 🐍
- Matplotlib (for the pretty pictures 🎨)
- Virtual Environment (`.venv`) to keep things neat 🧼
- A `requirements.txt` file to remember which tools we need
- A `.bat` file for one-click magic on Windows 🧙‍♂️

---

## 📍 What’s Working Great
- Chart renders beautifully and opens in a window
- Easy to edit data inside `monthly_chart_template.py`
- Saves the chart automatically
- Virtual env setup and clean folder structure

## 🔮 What’s Next (Future Dev Options)
Here are some magical seeds we can plant later 🌱:

- [ ] 📄 **Read data from Excel or Google Sheets**
- [ ] 🧑‍💼 **Add dropdowns or filters** using Streamlit
- [ ] 🧮 Auto-calculate **net income from income - expenses**
- [ ] 📆 Add support for any month range (not just Sept–Mar)
- [ ] 🌐 Build a web dashboard with interactivity (hover like QuickBooks)
- [ ] 📊 Use Plotly for dynamic charting
- [ ] 🧾 Export to PDF or full report package
- [ ] ✨ Add animations or transitions for visual flair

---

## 🐞 Known Glitches
- Some versions of Cursor might not auto-detect `.venv` until you select it manually (use `Python: Select Interpreter`)
- If you add too many expense categories, labels on bars may overlap 🤹

## 🤗 Final Thought
This isn’t just code. It’s a **practice in clarity, intention, and joy**. 
Thanks for being part of this — future-you is gonna love you for keeping it tidy ✨💜
