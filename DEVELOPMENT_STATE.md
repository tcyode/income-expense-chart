# 🛠️ Development Notes & Roadmap (Baba Style)

Hey developer soul 👩‍💻👨‍💻 — welcome to the inside scoop! ✨ This doc keeps track of everything we've done, what's cooking, and where this little chart friend could grow next. Think of it as your cozy dev diary 📓💡

## ✅ What We Built
- A Python program that turns income + expenses into a **stacked bar chart**
- **Green bars** for income 💚, stacked colors for expense categories 🌈
- A **red dotted line** for net income ❤️📉📈
- Sweet little **labels for March 2025** categories for clarity 🏷️
- Export to PNG with high quality
- Clipboard tool UI for easy data pasting
- Type row support to accurately identify Income, Expense, and Net Income columns
- CSV file import option for structured data
- Automatic net income calculation when not provided in the data
- Daily cash balance visualization with multiple account lines
- Upper (green) and lower (red) threshold lines with custom labels
- Data editor for fixing date and value errors

## 🧱 Tools We Used
- Python 3 🐍
- Matplotlib (for the pretty pictures 🎨)
- Tkinter (for the friendly UI 💻)
- Virtual Environment (`.venv`) to keep things neat 🧼
- A `requirements.txt` file to remember which tools we need
- A `.bat` file for one-click magic on Windows 🧙‍♂️

---

## 📍 What's Working Great
- Chart renders beautifully and opens in a window
- Easy to edit data inside `monthly_chart_template.py`
- Clipboard tool for quick data import from Excel/Google Sheets
- Support for spreadsheet-like "Type" row to identify column purposes
- Automatic calculation of Net Income if not provided
- Saves the chart automatically
- Virtual env setup and clean folder structure

  - ✅ Create CSV import function for daily cash data
  - ✅ Implement date parsing and handling
  - ✅ Set up account-based data transformation
  - ✅ Support for negative balance values
- ✅ Create enhanced UI for cash balance charts
  - ✅ Build file upload interface and clipboard input
  - ✅ Add chart configuration options with threshold controls
  - ✅ Implement chart rendering and saving
  - ✅ Add data editor for fixing dates and values

### Phase 1.6: Cash Flow Area Chart (Current Priority)

  - [ ] Build specialized upload interface
  - [ ] Add filtering capabilities by category
  - [ ] Implement zooming to specific date ranges
  - [ ] Support transaction annotations

Estimated time: 5-7 hours

### Phase 2: UI Enhancements (Next)
- ✅ Create a simple GUI interface with Tkinter
- [ ] Improve the UI to allow:
  - [ ] Select data files with dialog
  - [ ] Choose chart types (add more chart options)

## 🔮 What's Next (Future Dev Options)
Here are some magical seeds we can plant later 🌱:

- [x] 📄 **Read data from CSV files** ✅
- [x] 🧮 Auto-calculate **net income from income - expenses** ✅
- [x] 📋 **Accept data from clipboard** to make it easy to use ✅
- [ ] 📄 **Read data directly from Excel or Google Sheets**
- [ ] 🧑‍💼 **Add dropdowns or filters** using Streamlit
- [ ] 📆 Add support for any month range (not just Sept–Mar)
- [ ] 🌐 Build a web dashboard with interactivity (hover like QuickBooks)
- [ ] 📊 Use Plotly for dynamic charting
- [ ] 🧾 Export to PDF or full report package
- [ ] ✨ Add animations or transitions for visual flair

## 🐞 Known Glitches
- Some versions of Cursor might not auto-detect `.venv` until you select it manually (use `Python: Select Interpreter`)
- If you add too many expense categories, labels on bars may overlap 🤹
- ~~Net Income showing as an expense category in stacked bars instead of as a line~~ Fixed! ✅
- There's an error when adding a lower threshold and clicking "Process & Generate Chart" in some scenarios - investigating this issue
- Sometimes data with year-end transitions (Dec-Jan) may show anomalies in date formatting
- JSON serialization can fail with certain pandas objects (added workaround with custom encoder)

## 🔮 Final Thought
This isn't just code. It's a **practice in clarity, intention, and joy**. 
Thanks for being part of this — future-you is gonna love you for keeping it tidy ✨💜

Don't worry if you don't include NET INCOME - it will be calculated automatically!

## 💾 Where's My Chart?

After you run it, look in your folder! You'll find:

📄 output/[dataset_name].png ✅

You can share it, print it, or send it to your biz team 📈💌

## 🧙 How to Change the Numbers

Two easy ways:
1. Edit the spreadsheet where your data lives, then copy & paste into the clipboard tool
2. Open the `monthly_chart_template.py` file and update the data arrays directly
