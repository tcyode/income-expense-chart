# 🌟 Monthly Income vs. Expense Chart Generator (Baba Style)

Hi there, friend! 👋 Welcome to this cozy little Python project. It helps you make a beautiful chart that shows how much money came in 💚, how much went out 💸, and what's left each month ➕ ➖ = ❤️.

---

## 🎯 What This Project Does

This project creates colorful financial charts showing:

✅ Green bars for **income** (money in)
✅ Stacked bars for **expenses** by type (like payroll, materials, etc.)
✅ A dotted red line showing **net income** (income - expenses)
✅ Bonus! It highlights the last month with category labels ✨
✅ Daily cash balance visualization with multiple account lines
✅ Support for future balance projections with dotted lines

It also saves the chart as a picture file (PNG 📸) so you can use it anywhere.

## 💰 Daily Cash Balance Chart

This project now includes a full-featured daily cash balance visualization tool that:
- Shows multiple account balances over time as separate lines
- Displays a total balance line across all accounts
- Supports both upper (green) and lower (red) threshold lines with custom labels
- Provides intuitive date handling and formatting
- Includes a data editor for fixing date mistakes or value errors
- Supports negative account balances (like credit cards or loans)

Input format for daily cash balance data:
```csv
Date,Account,Balance
2023-01-01,Checking,5000.00
2023-01-01,Savings,15000.00
2023-01-01,Credit Card,-2500.00
...
```

## 🛠️ How to Set It Up (Just Once)

Open your terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt), and type:

```bash
python -m venv .venv  # makes a sandbox for your project 🏖️
.venv\Scripts\activate  # step into the sandbox 🧼
pip install -r requirements.txt  # grab the tools you need 🎨
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Chart (Every Time)

There are two ways to use this tool:

### Option 1: Use the original template script
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate  # activate your cozy coding space 🧘
python monthly_chart_template.py  # go make that chart! 🎉
```

Or you can double-click the `run_chart.bat` file if you're using Windows (it does all that for you 🤖).

### Option 2: Use the clipboard tool (Recommended)
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate  # activate your cozy coding space 🧘
python clipboard_tool.py  # launch the friendly UI! 🪟
```

With the clipboard tool, you can:
- Paste data from Excel/Google Sheets
- Import data from CSV files
- Add Type rows to properly classify your columns
- Generate charts with less hassle

## 📊 Data Format (Important!)

For best results, your data should include:
1. A header row with column names (first column should be "Month")
2. A "Type" row that identifies column types:
   - "Income" for income columns
   - "Expense" for expense columns
   - "NET INCOME" for net income columns
3. Your actual data rows with numbers

Example:

Month    Income    OPEX      PAYROLL   MATERIALS   NET INCOME
Type     Income    Expense   Expense   Expense     NET INCOME
Jan'24   1000      200       300       150         350
Feb'24   1100      210       320       160         410
```

Don't worry if you don't include NET INCOME - it will be calculated automatically!

## 💾 Where's My Chart?

After you run it, look in your folder! You'll find:

```
📄 output/[dataset_name].png ✅
```

You can share it, print it, or send it to your biz team 📈💌

---

## 🧙 How to Change the Numbers

Two easy ways:
1. Edit the spreadsheet where your data lives, then copy & paste into the clipboard tool
2. Open the `monthly_chart_template.py` file and update the data arrays directly

## 🐞 Known Glitches
- Some versions of Cursor might not auto-detect `.venv` until you select it manually (use `Python: Select Interpreter`)
- If you add too many expense categories, labels on bars may overlap 🤹
- ~~Net Income showing as an expense category in stacked bars instead of as a line~~ Fixed! ✅
- Client data is not being saved to disk. The data structure works in memory but `save_data()` method is not being called after chart generation. This needs to be fixed for true data persistence.
- There's an error when adding a lower threshold and clicking "Process & Generate Chart" in some scenarios - investigating this issue
- Sometimes data with year-end transitions (Dec-Jan) may show anomalies in date formatting
- JSON serialization can fail with certain pandas objects (added workaround with custom encoder)

## 🤗 Final Thought
This isn't just code. It's a **practice in clarity, intention, and joy**. 
Thanks for being part of this — future-you is gonna love you for keeping it tidy ✨💜

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- **Client Data Persistence**: Currently, client data is stored in memory but not automatically saved to disk. Data will be lost when the application is closed. This will be fixed in an upcoming update.

## 📊 Chart Types

The project currently supports two types of financial charts:

1. **Monthly Income vs. Expense Chart** (Income/Expense Stacked Bar Chart)
   - Green bars for income
   - Stacked colored bars for expenses by category
   - Red dotted line for net income
   - Last month highlights with category labels

2. **Daily Cash Balance Chart** (Multi-line Cash Flow Chart)
   - Line graph showing balance for each account over time
   - Bold line showing total balance across all accounts
   - Customizable threshold lines (upper green, lower red)
   - Support for negative balances (credit cards, loans)
   - Date-based X-axis with proper formatting
   - Built-in data editor for fixing mistakes

## 📊 Upcoming Chart Types

The next planned chart type is a **Cash Flow Area Chart**:

- Visualizes cash flow as a flowing area chart
- Supports multiple transactions on the same day
- Works with running balance data structure
- Includes positive/negative region visualization
- Offers date range zooming and filtering
- Provides transaction annotation capabilities
